# CART 315 Exploration Prototype 3

<b>Design Hypothesis</b>  

<br>

By presenting to the player a timed escape-room-and-labyrinth game, if I hide the door that allows the player to win the game, will the player take their time to explore the room first or go for one of the colourful doors to find a way to escape the labyrinth? 

<br>

<b>List of questions for playtesters</b>
<ol><li>Was it confusing teleporting from one place to another?</li> 
<li>Did the countdown timer stress you out? Did it make you rush?</li> 
<li>Is the game too hard for an escape room/labyrinth theme?</li>
<li>What do you think of the instructions? Were they clear and motivating to get it done before the time ran out?</li></ol>
